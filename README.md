> **Abstract:** 
*The rise of deep neural networks has led to several breakthroughs for semantic segmentation.
In spite of this, a model trained on source domain often fails to work properly in new challenging domains, that is directly concerned with the generalization capability of the model. 
In this paper, we present a novel memory-guided domain generalization method for semantic segmentation based on meta-learning framework.
Especially, our method abstracts the conceptual knowledge of semantic classes into categorical memory which is constant beyond the domains.
Upon the meta-learning concept, we repeatedly train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain.
To this end, we also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to learn memory reading and update processes for category-aware domain generalization.
Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method over state-of-the-art works on various benchmarks.*<br>

## Pytorch Implementation
### Installation
Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Genie-Kim/PintheMemory.git
cd PintheMemory
```
### Installation Requirements
```
python >= 3.7
Pytorch >= 1.9.0
CUDA version >= 11.0
Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Run
We evaludated our method on [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/), [Mapillary Vistas](https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas?pKey=2ix3yvnjy9fwqdzwum3t9g&lat=20&lng=0&z=1.5), [BDD-100K](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/30/bdd/),[Synthia](https://synthia-dataset.net/downloads/) ([SYNTHIA-RAND-CITYSCAPES](http://synthia-dataset.net/download/808/)), [GTAV](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/)

1. For Cityscapes dataset, download "leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip" and "gtFine_trainvaltest.zip" from https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/<br>
```

```

2. You should modify the path in **"config.py"** according to your dataset path.
```
#Cityscapes Dir Location
__C.DATASET.CITYSCAPES_DIR = <YOUR_CITYSCAPES_PATH>
#Mapillary Dataset Dir Location
__C.DATASET.MAPILLARY_DIR = <YOUR_MAPILLARY_PATH>
#GTAV Dataset Dir Location
__C.DATASET.GTAV_DIR = <YOUR_GTAV_PATH>
#BDD-100K Dataset Dir Location
__C.DATASET.BDD_DIR = <YOUR_BDD_PATH>
#Synthia Dataset Dir Location
__C.DATASET.SYNTHIA_DIR = <YOUR_SYNTHIA_PATH>
```

Training and evaluation scripts are coming soon!ðŸ‘‹
